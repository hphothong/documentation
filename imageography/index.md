## FAQs

### How do I share my saved locations with friends?

The best way is to send them the address from the marker details page of the application.
We are currently working on making the applications online which would support sharing marker locations with friends!

### What happens to my data (i.e., images, markers, etc.) when I delete the app from my phone?

Currently the application holds all of your data locally. If you delete the application from your phone, then you will lose all of your data.
