- **Legal Obligations:** We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, government requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal processes, such as in response to a court order or subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).

- **Vital Interests:** We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take actions regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.

More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations:

- **Business Transfers.** We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

- **Business Partners.** We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain products, services, or promotions.

### 3. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?

**In Short:** _We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information._

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.

### 4. DO WE USE GOOGLE MAPS?

**In Short:** Yes, we use Google Maps for the purpose of providing better service.

This App uses Google Maps APIs which is subject to Google’s Terms of Service. You may find the Google Maps APIs Terms of Service [here](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/). To find out more about Google’s Privacy Policy, please refer to this [link](https://policies.google.com/privacy). We obtain and store on your device (‘cache’) your location. You may revoke your consent anytime by contacting us at the contact details provided at the end of this document.

### 5. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?

**In Short:** _We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own._

Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our App from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see “[WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?](#2-will-your-information-be-shared-with-anyone)” above), in the United States and other countries.

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.

### 6. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?

**In Short:** _We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third-party providers who advertise, but are not affiliated with, our Website or App._

The App may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, online services, or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the App. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.

### 7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

**In Short:** _We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law._

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us to keep your personal information for longer than 2 years.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

### 8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

**In Short:** _We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures._

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only access the App within a secure environment.

### 9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

**In Short:** _You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time._

If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details [here](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm).

If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available [here](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html).

### 10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

### 11. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?

**In Short:** _Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information._

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclose to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the App, you have the right to request the removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the App. To request the removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the App, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g., backups, etc.).

### 12. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?

**In Short:** _Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws._

We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification.
